# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Our institute needs to maintain a database for library management system. The database will store
information like book name, author's name, id, issue status (available or issued), student id (if issued),
due date (if issued), fine (@Rs.5/day after 15 days of book issue).

In addition to this the administration also needs to perform the following tasks on the database:

i) It allows the admin to add, delete, update (id etc.) and edit (issue or return) the book's
information.
ii) It allows to admin to view the books issued to a particular student.
iii) It allows the user to search information of a particular book using their unique identification
number.
iv) It should allow the user to check status of books he has issued.

It should not allow a student to issue more than 4 books at a time. Also, if at the time of return of books
due date is crossed output the applicable fine.
Now write a java code which will do the job for the institute.
